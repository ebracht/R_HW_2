## Valentine's Day Consumer Data Trends

### **Trends by Gift Type**

By collapsing Candy, Clothing, Evening Out, Flowers, Gift Cards,
Greeting Cards, and Jewelry into one variable (Gift Type), we can see
how each individual product performs from 2010-2022. This can inform
inventory planning and marketing strategies.

### Item Performance

Highlights Jewelry and an evening out consistently receive the most
spending; however, evenings out took a dip during/after the COVID-19
pandemic and have not quite caught back up. In 2020, clothing actually
spiked up to differentiate itself from the lower performing pack of
other gifts. Greeting cards remain consistent, but low in spending.
Flowers, candy, and gift cards are low but steady, with a slight uptick
in the past couple of years while higher performers were experiencing
more dramatic fluctuations.

### Inventory Strategy Recommendations

I would advise prioritizing a high inventory of jewelry for Valentine's
Day. Given the slightly up-and-down nature of evenings out following
COVID, I recommend monitoring public health trends and at-home activity
to best understand the climate in which you are trying to market/sell
and use this to inform inventory/offers. As clothes seem to be trending
positively, paying close attention to the specific kinds of clothing
that sell best around this time could be key in terms of identifying
which to keep the highest inventories of. Continue stocking items like
flowers, candy, gift cards, and greeting cards with similar amounts to
past years.
